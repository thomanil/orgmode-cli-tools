FAQ
====

Q: Src code in my original org file is syntax highlighted in emacs,
and is htmlized with colors when I convert manually from within Emacs,
yet I get no colored syntax highlighting when converting with org2html
or org2revealjs. What gives?

A: Inline styling of code doesn't work in emacs "batch mode". However
the code elements are given classes (function, keyword etc), so you
are free to add css styling for your code as a final step yourself.
